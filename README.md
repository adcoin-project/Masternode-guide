# AdCoin Masternode Guide

The Adcoin Masternode-Guide.md provides all of the basic steps to create a working masternode.

The steps assume a remote VPS with a unique public IP address and root access.

A VPS cost from 5 - 10 $ each month.

Vultr has one for 5 $ per month.

Ubuntu 18.04 is what we are recommending.

We recommend the program Termius which is free.

The setup is easier with this program when running the commands on the VPS
